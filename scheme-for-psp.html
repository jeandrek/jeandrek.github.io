	<h2>Scheme for PSP</h2>

	  I started fiddling with PSP homebrew and, thinking about the Scheme
	  interpreter which I had written in RISC-V assembly for my
	  <a href="https://github.com/jeandrek/scratch-risc-v-programs">
	    Scratch RISC-V emulator
	  </a>
	  around early 2022, started wondering how similar MIPS assembly would
	  be to RISC-V assembly, or if it would even be possible to get it to
	  assemble with little more than a few substitutions&hellip; and much
	  to my surprise, this was actually possible.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I replaced all instances of <code>mv</code> with <code>move</code>,
	  <code>call</code> with <code>jal</code>, <code>lla</code> with
	  <code>la</code>, <code>ret</code> with <code>jr $ra</code>, etc.; and
	  changed the registers where needed (adding dollar signs), after
	  which it, to my excitement, assembled to an object file fine (without
	  linking or working, obviously).  From there it wasn't very long till
	  I got something that started working on PSP with pspsdk's debug
	  screen.  As of now, though, the original being written, obviously,
	  with RISC-V in mind, the interpreter's own routines don't respect the
	  MIPS calling convention; more specifically <code>$a0</code> is used
	  for return values as well as arguments and <code>$v0</code> isn't
	  taken advantage of at all.  From there I've started expanding it,
	  with more features hopefully to come.

	  For now, the library goes in /boot.scm on the memory stick.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I thought about also running it as a program under a Unix-like system
	  on MIPS.  So I subsequently tried compiling for NetBSD under gxemul,
	  but for some reason only got it to work by compiling with
	  <code>-fno-pic</code> and using <code>syscall</code> instead of any
	  library calls.  So for now I will probably ignore platforms other than
	  PSP.
