	  As I said in my last post, I've started attempting PSP homebrew, and
	  around December 2024 I started this project (a portable 3D checkers
	  program using either OpenGL or the PSP APIs or potentially more
	  consoles).  Now you can interact with it and actually play, albeit
	  without a computer opponent (local multiplayer only) and everything
	  is very much bare-bones.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Supports PSP, and with OpenGL, Windows and POSIX/X11, with Carbon Mac
	  support on a separate branch for now (supports classic Mac OS and OS
	  X, not beyond Mojave; may consider porting to Cocoa instead).  (I've
	  also meant from the beginning to keep open possibly expanding to
	  include chess or anything else as well, but thought checkers easier.)
